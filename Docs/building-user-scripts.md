# Building User Scripts

User Scripts (JavaScript injected into the `WKWebView`) are compiled, concatenated and minified using [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/). User Scripts to be aggregated are placed in the following directories:

```
/Client
|-- /Frontend
    |-- /UserContent
        |-- /UserScripts
            |-- /AllFrames
            |   |-- /AtDocumentEnd
            |   |-- /AtDocumentStart
            |-- /MainFrame
                |-- /AtDocumentEnd
                |-- /AtDocumentStart
```

This reduces the total possible number of User Scripts down to four. The compiled output from concatenating and minifying the User Scripts placed in these folders resides in `/Client/Assets` and are named accordingly:

- `AllFramesAtDocumentEnd.js`
- `AllFramesAtDocumentStart.js`
- `MainFrameAtDocumentEnd.js`
- `MainFrameAtDocumentStart.js`

To simplify the build process, these compiled files are checked-in to this repository. When adding or editing User Scripts, these files can be re-compiled with `webpack` manually. This requires Node.js to be installed and all required `npm` packages can be installed by running `npm install` in the root directory of the project. User Scripts can be compiled by running the following `npm` command in the root directory of the project:

```
npm run build
```
